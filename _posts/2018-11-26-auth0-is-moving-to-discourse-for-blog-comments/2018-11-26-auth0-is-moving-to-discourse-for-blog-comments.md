We’re just finishing up the process of switching away from DISQUS to use an embedded version of our [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forum based [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/) on the blog.

This means that, instead of using DISQUS at the bottom of blog posts for readers to provide feedback and ask questions, we’ll be using Discourse instead.

Engaging our authors and readers in the community will benefit everyone in the long run. The community is quickly fulfilling its goal to become a valuable source of knowledge for developers using Auth0. It makes sense to further focus our efforts on that resource, instead of leaving valuable questions and answers isolated on the blog pages.

## What About My Existing Questions?

Existing blog posts will continue to display and use DISQUS for the foreseeable future. So only future questions will require you to log in.

## What Do I Need to Do?

Nothing, really. As a frequent reader, you could [sign up](https://community.auth0.com/) ahead of time, for the Auth0 Community.
