Developer Advocate Luke Oliff joins the Nexmo Developer Relations team to focus on JavaScript Advocacy and spreading the good word of security and tooling.

Hi! My name is Luke, and I'm delighted to be joining the Nexmo Developer Relations team. I'm primarily based in Colchester, which no one has ever heard of. But, fun facts; It's Britain's ["oldest recorded town,"](https://www.visitcolchester.com/explore/britains-oldest-town.aspx) host of a Norman Castle, home of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" and it has [a pretty big Zoo](https://www.colchester-zoo.com).

I've been involved in the web for more than half my life, having picked up the basics before I left high school. Around the same time, I cut my teeth in coding by learning PHP or writing some sketchy JavaScript. In the last six years, I've had the good fortune to lead teams, architect APIs, write amazing technical content, and now join a world-class Developer Relations team.

I'm a big advocate for security and open source software. Most recently, I've written about [The Importance of Securing Your Version Control](https://medium.com/@lukecodes/the-importance-of-securing-your-version-control-131841429994) using signed commits to verify the identity of the developer. I also started [a "get involved in OS" initiative](https://my-first-pr.github.io), that encourages developers to make a small contribution to an open source project, with a hand to hold through the process.

I love to talk about technology, [Greyhounds](https://twitter.com/greyhoundollie) (dogs, not buses), and being a dad. If you want to connect, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mroliff) or the [Nexmo Community Slack](https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack).
