Hackference returns for its 6th year, ran and founded by the amazing [Mike Elsmore](https://twitter.com/ukmadlz). Its purpose is to provide a unique and hands-on learning environment free of any negative influences.

[Jeremy Meiss](https://twitter.com/iamjerdog) gave a great talk on [power and value of identity providers](https://auth0.com/blog/5-reasons-your-company-needs-identity-and-access-management/) at Friday's conference, and we remained on hand for the rest of the weekend to support the Hackathon.


## What You Missed at the Conference

This year, the conference included two tracks: Innovate and Develop. Across these two tracks, speakers included [Doug Sillars](https://twitter.com/dougsillars) on modern image delivery techniques, [Karina Popova](https://twitter.com/kary_key) on geospatial analysis of Twitter content, [Alex Lakatos](https://twitter.com/lakatos88) on natural conversation pieces with bots, and [Jessica Rose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose) on a common issue in tech, Burnout. These are to name but a few. [Check out the schedule to see what you missed](https://2018.hackference.co.uk/#schedule).

## Hackathon Winners (of Auth0's prize)

Anna, Carol and Jamie of team "Who Dis?" built an advanced identity service designed to be self-hosted. Based on the IndieAuth login system, their app was created as a custom Auth0 identity provider. When accessing the app, authentication is requested via Auth0's centralised login page where you could select their custom identity provider which could then verify identity.

## Hackathons

Hackathons are an important part of the development world! True innovation and creativity can be expressed in a supportive and collaborative environment, often with the added incentive of some amazing prizes.

Some famous features and products have been born from hackathons. Most notably, the [Facebook “Like” button and Facebook Chat](http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-hackathons-2017-6) were both born at company internal hackathons.

In an environment where innovation and creativity are nurtured, amazing things can happen.
